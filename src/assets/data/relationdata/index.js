            "Martin Luther King Jr. was a man of great stature, what he has done for the African-American community is undeniable, but something that many people overlook is where MLK’s idea to stand up against the oppression of people came from. As Øvyind M. Eide describes MLK his source was the Gospel of Jesus Christ, “His (MLK) strength and vision came from his Christian faith. He claimed quite ",
            "plainly that oppression and the Gospel of Jesus do not go together.” (Life and Ministry Pg. 42).Many forget that MLK was a Reverend and he understood that his participation in the struggle for equality came from his biblical understanding of life.The way to understand MLK’s approach to injustice according to Dr.J.Kameron Carter is, “He was a churchman from beginning to end.” The gospel is how MLK chose to respond.THis is where we can begin drawing the similarity between King and Gudina; they shared in the understanding that the Gospel was the saving power of God",
                  "To understand how an Ethiopian and an American during the 1900’s can relate we have to go back to 1963-66 Gudina’s time being educated in the US. The three years Gudina spent in the United States could be described as the height of the Civil Rights movement. People who knew Gudina Tumsa claim that his understanding of the Gospel’s role in justice, equality and human rights came from his interest in MLK and the Civil Rights Movement that was going on around him during his education. As Paul Wee recounts Gudina’s life he says this about the Civil Rights Movement that influenced Gudina, “When he was a student at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Gudina was exposed to the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement, the public protests by the Black population of the US against decades of discrimination led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He was not only fascinated by what was happening on the streets of the cities in the mid-1960s; he was intensely interested in the biblical rationale for the involvement of King and the Churches.” (Church and Society Pg.41). Gudina was involved as many other students were, but not only because it was a struggle for racial equality. But what particularly interested him was how Martin Luther King Jr. Stood for the Gospel, and applied the Gospel to the reality of his people. One influence of Gudina’s theological bases–the holistic theology– is Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.",
                  "There are many similarities between Gudina Tumsa and MLK but the two main aspects of these men that relate them is their approach of non-violence and their vision through the perspective of the Gospel. Gudina in his time stood for what the Gospel compelled him to do. But he did it in a way inspired by MLK–that method is the non-violent approach–  this is seen when Paul Wee writes, “Gudina took the path of non-violent opposition and patient suffering.” (Church and Society Pg.17). MLK also took this nonviolent approach in the marches, speeches, boycotts and sermons he organized. Today both Gudina and MLK are looked down upon by some because they did not condone armed resistance. But the most important similarity between the two is that they stood for what they believed in; and that is the Gospel. Finally both men are joined in the price they paid for their Biblical stance, they paid with their lives for defending the true form of the Gospel which guarantees freedoms and equality to all humans. "

            // "“When we see his life and work, we can confirm that he was rightly compared with Dietrich Bonhoeffer of Germany, who boldly opposed the ideology of Hitler and spoke publicly against it. He was then murdered by the Hitler regime, ready to sacrifice his life for the cause of the gospel. He was unselfish, bold, and prepared to help others up to the point of self-sacrifice. Rev.Gudina came in contact with the theology of Bonhoeffer during his stay at Luther Seminary in St. Paul,MN, USA”"

              paragraph: [
                  "Many will disagree, question, and even be opposed to comparing Gudina Tumsa and Abiy Ahmed. But before any assumptions are made we would like for you to read and understand and we hope that it changes your heart. If not, like Gudina said, “I will try to justify my statements I have made here. If I cannot justify them I would admit that I am mistaken.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.114)",
                  "Firstly–just to scratch the surface– we have to begin by drawing a connection with the leadership style of these two men. Gudina Tumsa was a theologian whose overarching purpose was to minister the gospel in a way that serves the “whole man'' or what is known as holistic theology: which consists of the physical, spiritual, educational, political and the economical betterment of man’s situation. Abiy Ahmed Ali is a politician who currently is the Prime-minister of Ethiopia. His style of leadership is service as he claims and believes that the purpose of politicians and the government is to better the living situation of their citizens economically, politically and ideologically. Because of the many similarities that Gudina Tumsa and Abiy Ahmed have, the Gudina Tumsa Foundation and The Mekane Yesus Seminary worked in partnership, to prepare a seminar comparing Gudina Tumsa’s holistic theology and Abiy Ahmed Ali’s Medmer philosophy",
                  "To go a step further past the surface we have to know and understand the thought pattern of both men. The most similar thought pattern both men present is their vision for unity. One amongst the Church, the other amongst a Nation.  ",
                  "Gudina Tumsa’s idea of unity, is about the oneness of the body of Christ, he presents his idea of this unity using the word “hibret” which translates to association or fellowship; is a theologically based idea for the Churches of different confessions in Ethiopia to find a form of unity that will allow them to work together in order help the people that they claim to serve. His idea of how “hibret'' should work is seen when he writes, “If the Tenth General Assembly votes to join the WCC the action will pave the way for the ECMY and the Orthodox to start discussions on how to discharge their responsibilities for the Ethiopian people.” (Life and Ministry Pg.136). Gudina Tumsa had a great concern for the people that he chose to serve through the power of the Gospel. He believed that cooperation amongst the Churches could serve the “whole man” in order to build a better society. Hibret is an idea that derives from Gudina’s holistic understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is meant to create relationships between the divided churches of Christ, it is a ecumenical concept meant to develop integral humans and it is the first step on a path that would lead to oneness in the Church which is the prayer of the Lord Jesus Christ.",
                  "Abiy Ahmed Ali, the Prime minister of Ethiopia, has developed a similar idea which he calls “medmer” when translated to English the word is “synergy”. A philosophical idea meant to help find a form of unity among the many different ethnic groups in Ethiopia. The medmer idea is a political ideology developed for a government and a nation. Abiy Ahmed believes the medemer idea can help heal a nation divided by ethic differences, violence and create a better society that will bring Ethiopia into an era of prosperity. Medmer is a idea that is meant to help the government serve their people to the best of their ability. Abiy Ahmed believes that medmer is the only way forward in Ethiopia, he believes that it is powerful enough to heal generational rifts, poverty and underdevelopment. The medmer idea is a way for a divided country to create sustainable relationships and it is the path that has the capability to lead to a united Ethiopia regardless of the different ethnicities, languages and cultures. The ideas of hibret and medmer. Find their common ground firstly in the groups they are addressing. Both groups are divided even though they are supposed to be united. Another overarching key point that brings these two ideas together is that they remove the stereotype that unity is uniformity. ",
                  "To begin drawing more similarities we have to begin looking into their job criterias. Firstly both politicians and theologians serve a kingdom; one serves a kingdom of earth and the other serves The Kingdom of Heaven. To go even further we may bring up the fact that both serve the needs of people. Lastly the similarities between the two positions is found in the responsibilities to the people they serve. To bring these similarities to the case of Gudina Tumsa and Abiy Ahmed we must see the commonality in the people that they serve: a multi-ethnic group of people. Abiy Ahmed leads the nation of Ethiopia which consists of 90 distinct ethnic groups. While Gudina led the Mekane Yesus Church a multi-ethnic church founded and based in Ethiopia. Oyvind M.Edie writes about Gudina’s leadership of a multi-ethnic church in this way, “The EECMY was active in many parts of Ethiopia and could not be identified with any particular ethnic group. This church was an example of integrating the various nationalities of the country,” (Life and Ministry Pg.67). Gudina’s and Abiy’s leadership comes to a crossroads, because their responses are directed to the people they serve, and their goals are intended to solve the problems facing their people today. ",
                  "The similarities of these two men continue with more detail. This detail can be found  when you look into the issues both men addressed through their thinking. For example issues such as hibret/medmer, interdependence, self-reliance and national/church integrity. The hibret and medmer ideas have been compared above as they are two ideologies that should be the starting point when comparing these two men. ",
                  "Both Gudina Tumsa and Abiy Ahmed call for interdependence. Gudina Tumsa believed that the Church of Christ is universal and amongst this universal Church he called for interdependence. He called for the sharing of resources amongst the Church, so that the Churches may work together to further the cause of Christ and to serve the people in a holistic approach. His idea of interdependence was meant to help the Churches give help to one another and cover each other's weakness so that the ministry of the Church may be better he understood the saying “Stronger Together”. Abiy Ahmed also calls for interdependence between the government and its citizens, as he believes that if the government and the people work together it is the best way to develop a better society and economy. The interdependence between the government and the people forms trust, so that citizens believe in their government, it creates a way for citizens to get involved in raising their standard of living, leaving a brighter future for the nex generation and it creates a fast, sustainable and reliable model for the nation to develop and for that growth to reach each and every citizen. The interdependence between the government and citizens is intended for the citizens to cover the weak areas of the government and for the government to help cover the weak areas of the citizens, again pointing to the saying “Stronger together”. ",
                  "Self-reliance may seem like a conflict of interest , as we just claimed both men believed in interdependence. But interdependence, by the definition of both men, does not exclude the possibility of some independence. Interdependence means covering one another's weak areas, and someone who is totally dependent cannot help themselves, much rather anyone else. Thus, Gudina Tumsa advocated that the Church be self-reliant so that it may carry out its mission in a way that it deems correct. The way that missions of that time were trying to control how the national EECMY church ministered, to its people created in Gudina the understanding that unless the church became self-reliant they would never be considered equal and that the western churches would always have a “paternalistic” view of the EECMY. Abiy Ahmed’s Medemer philosophy includes how Ethiopia can catch up to the developed nations of the world. When he refers to catching up to those nations he means, being considered equal among them and in order to do this Ethiopia needs to become self-reliant and economically prosperous. Ethiopia present day is a nation dependent on foriegn aid for many things such as development work, health care, etc… Just as the EECMY was dependent on foreign missions to complete their evanglistic and development work during the leadership of Gudina. Both individuals believe in self-reliance as a necessity to find equality, and serve their people in the way they think is best (A contextualized way). Lastly we have to mention Gudina’s idea of the Church being a paradigm for society. Gudina Tumsa was not only an advocate for self-reliance in the Church, but his idea that the church should be a model for  the government meant he wished the same for the state. “Having set the goal of self-reliance for itself, the ECMY supports the goal of self-reliance for Ethiopian Society.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.82) ",
                  "Church/National integrity refers to the state of being whole or undivided. In simpler terms it means not being influenced or used for any purpose other than your own. To understand how Gudina Tumsa and Abiy Ahmed relate on the topic of integrity we have to understand their approach and the events occurring when both wrote on this topic. Gudina Tumsa’s holistic theology led him to claim that a church was a national church and thus, the church should have its own integrity, “We have come to this stage in our historical development, where as a national Church we have to maintain integrity and assert maturity”. (Witness and Discipleship Pg.109). Gudina had strong opinions on some missions that were trying to use the EECMY as an agent during his leadership. He denounced this when he wrote, “The Church of Jesus Christ can never be used as an agent by anyone except for the One who had died for her.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.110). Gudina understood that a national Church is sovereign from the control of foreign Churches, the Church can only be controlled by God. Meaning that a national Church should have the right to interpret and find solutions for its own issues on its own merits. Coming to Abiy Ahmed, there should be no questions as to why a sovereign nation should have its own integrity. But Abiy Ahmed himself had to fight inorder to protect the sovereignty and integrity of Ethiopia as can be seen in his open letter to President Joseph Biden, Abiy writes “This optimism has been rooted in the belief that a new dispensation for Africa - US relations will materialize in 2021, and that you Presidency would usher in respect for the sovereignty of African nations.”This open letter came at a time when Ethiopia was being punished by sanctions for protecting it national interests. Abiy and Gudina Tumsa can both be seen defending the integrity of their respective platforms of service. In conclusion, both Gudina Tumsa and Abiy Ahmed faced challenges against the integrity of their institutions. The challenge was presented because of “paternalistic, colonial and neo-colonial” practices. As Gudina wrote when addressing a German mission, “This kind of paternalistic, colonial attitude can never be tolerated, can never be accepted.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.109). And Abiy also wrote in his letter to President Joseph Biden, “African nations that have broken free from the shackles of colonialism starting for the 1950s have continued to resist the chains of colonialism that is manifesting itself in various overt and covert ways.”",
                  "In conclusion, many similarities can be drawn between Abiy Ahmed and Gudina Tumsa, from generic things such as the country they were born and served in, their positions in leadership and their style of leadership which is service. But if we look deeper and analyze both men, we are able to see beyond the surface and to the wealth they possess in their thoughts. Both men came into a leadership position at a crucial and troublesome time, one during a revolution where marxism was threatening the existence of his Church, the other came to leadership into a nation that was on the verge of state collapse. Their thoughts, reforms and leadership style is drawn from the risky environment their leadership term came to be. Their response was intended to combat the risk that faced their respective institutions. These men were able to acknowledge the issue, begin restoring their institutions' responsibility, survive the turmoil and renew how their institutions worked inorder for there to be sustainable work and change, with what God entrusted to them. Their similarities come from their experiences and their experiences shape their thought, and their thought is a solution to the crisis around them and the future ahead. We can say that  Reverend Gudina Tumsa’s belief and writings that the Church is a model for society is being manifested decades later through the leadership of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed."

                "Ditrech Bonhoffer was a German theologian and church leader that ministerd during the Nazi regime. He is famous for being apart of the July 20th conspiracy to overthrow Hitler, writing many theological writtings that still resonate with Christians today such as the Cost of Discipeship and being executed by the armed wing of the Nazi regime.",
                "It may puzzle some people what an Ethiopian and a German theologian who were born 25 years apart have in common.This assumption is fair.But the power of the Gospel whose source is Jesus Chirst is the same yesterday, today and forever, D]decades and borders have no effect on His scope.Both Bonhoeffer and Gudina find their common ground in their Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.Their common ground– the Gospel– is what brought them together.During his time studying in the United States Gudina picked up and learned a lot about Bonhoeffer, what particularly interested him was Bonhoeffer's approach to the Cost of Discipleship and how Bonhoeffer stood up against the oppressions of faith and people.",
                  " Gudina took these from Bonhoeffer and applied them in his own ministry and thus today Gudina is referred to as the Bonhoeffer of Africa.Paul Wee writes on what led Gudina to become interested in Bonhoeffer which later influence his theology, “Gudina was, I believe, drawn to Bonhoeffer for two main reasons; first, because the German theologian was radically Christ- centered, without at the same time finding it necessary to abandon life in the world; secondly, because Bonhoeffers experience with Nazism during the Third Reich was akin to the Ethiopian experience during the period of Italian fasicm in the late 1930’s.” (Church and Society Pg.25). Because Gudina was influenced by Bonhoeffer he understood the Gospel—which is how both men interpreted life– in a similar way to Bonhoeffer.According to Paul Wee that similarity can be found in their belief that Christ was the center of life also known as the holistic approach. “The Bonhoeffer - Gudina legacy offers a single, unequivocal answer.It does so, not only by focusing on the centrality of Jesus Christ within the biblical witness, in which the passion narrative and its meaning for the whole creation is dominant; it does so by demonstrating how the power of death and resurrection is the power of transformation and hope at the heart of individual and community life.” (Church and Society Pg.43). Their theological understanding that Christ was the center of life, As Paul Wee wirtes, meant that He was at the center of everything, from the day to day, to the church and even the government, “For both Bonhoeffer and Gudina, following Luther, there is one Lord over both church and state.” (Church and Society Pg.35). This is the essence of the correlation between Gudina Tumsa and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the fact that they used their biblical perspective to interact with the political situation that they faced, is a vital link between the two.",
                  "Both Gudina’s and Bonhoeffer's situation was one of persecution. The state persecuted religion, murdered and oppressed all aspects of life, “Bonhoffer and Gudina were brought face to face with the burning issues of racial disrimnation and economic and political injustice.” (Church and Society Pg.18). -Paul Wee. Gudina ministred through an oppressive Socialist regime “the Derg” and Dietrich under the infamous “Nazi Regime”. Both regimes are known for some of the most atrocious events committed in human history. The Derg’s most publized genocide is known as the “Red Terror” a two year period spanning from 1976-1978 in which an estimated 500,000 people were murderd by the state. The Nazi regime was responsible for the most barbaric geneocide in human history, the Holocaust, in which there was a mass murder of 6 million Jews. Both Gudina and Bonhoffer understood that their Chirstian responsibility meant responding to the crisis around them for the sake of the Gospel, which is intended to defend the rights of the oppressed. Both men in their own respective ways stood up against the oppression of people. Gudina refused to deny the truth, and lie to the world saying the Derg was for the people. Dietrich’s struggle was different as he took an armed approach, but he also stood for the people being oppressed. Their zealousness, for the truth which is the Gospel leads us to their final link. Found in their death because of the name of Christ and the responsibilities that come with that name. Ditrech Bonhoeffer wrote in the Cost of Discipleship ``When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die.” Gudina inspired by Dietrich Bonhoeffer worte, “As someone has said, when a person is called to follow Christ, that person is called to die”. (Witness and Discipleship Pg.11). Paul Wee, the man who identifies this link between the two  writes, “It is at this point that the life and witness of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Gudina Tumsa converge.” (Church and Society Pg.36). To conclude we see that the overarching link between Gudina and Dietrich starts because of Christ. The link continues to be seen in how they understood the calling God had for them. Their final link is made clear in their willingness to follow the will of God to the point of death. The legacy of these two men is one of Christ centered discipleship at any and every cost. "
