            "Gudina Tumsa’s final writing is about  the Responsibility of a Christian in a Given Society.He firmly states in his writing that a Christian’s main responsibility is to serve the Lord Jesus Christ and to know God’s will throughout every action in their life, “A Christian should stay in prayer for guidance, so that he/she knows the will of God for any action he/she may take.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.10)  Many Chrsitans acknowledge and agree with the fact that serving the Gospel is our ultimate purpose. But Gudina Tumsa also advocated for individuals to serve their country to their maximum capability. He believed that a christian was born in a specific country to serve and better it. He stated, ",
            "The Christian should invest his / her money, time, knowledge and life, as well as anything else he may treasure, in the interest of his / her country.” (Pg.7 Wittenss and Discipleship). In general, Gudina’s understanding of a Chrsitan’s responsibility means: That one is accountable to the wellbeing of his/her country both physically and spiritually.",
            "Prior to his abduction and death Gudina Tumsa wrote what many call his last will and testament which he titled “The Role of a Chiristian in a Given Society.” In this document he gives a testament to his understanding of the faith as it pertains to a Chirsitans life. This article written by him defines Gudina Tumsa as a whole; his life, faith and works from the beginning to the end. He discusses how a Christian should always put God first, serve their country and most importantly he writes about martyrdom, which he knew was the fate ahead of him. As Christian Krause one of his colleagues writes;   “Gudina was not a man without fear. He would not have liked to be made a hero. He always said he was afirad of torture. ‘If that would only pass me by’, he said. But he saw that the cup was on the table and he accepted to drink it.” (Church and Society Pg.113). ",
            "We must understand that Gudina’s understanding of a Christian’s role came from the Bible and his life experiences and sacrifices that he made for the Gospel.",
            "Gudina Tumsa himself was a responsible Christian, and the evidence for this lies in the fact that he chose to follow the will of God unto the point of death as can be seen when Kes. Iteffa Gobena writes what Gudina said to him as they were walking out of the ECMY Head Office:  “You boys, do you know that one day this Derg will kill me on a road side such as this, and will get rid of me?” (Church and Society Pg.222). ",
            "But his Chrisitan responsibility is not only seen in his obedience to death, but in his obedience throughout every part of his life. Some examples are; Gudina was willing to leave the medical field– assured comfort– for a life of following Christ, he was willing to leave his wife and children to get the education God wanted him to get, he was willing to lead the Church God had established in a way that God had ordained and he was willing to stand for what the Bible commanded him to stand for. An example of Gudina following the commands of the Bible is when he refused to conform like many others did around him. Paul E. Hoffman describes Gudina not conforming in this way,",
            "“Once when asked whether there was religious persecution in Ethiopia, the Catholics, the Orthodox and Muslims said “No!”, where as GT had said: “I cannot deny the fact that Christians are being persecuted.” (Life and Ministry Pg.170). ",
            "The responsibility that Gudina Tumsa developed in his Chirstian life can be accredited to two specific things: His life of prayer and his habit of reading the word of God. His prayer life is something that many have given testament to, it is how he made every single decision and it led him in the right direction. Paul E. Hoffmann describes Gudina’s prayer life in this way, ",
            "Prayer- and in this he was by no means unique- played an important part in Gudina’s own personal life.” (Life and Ministry Pg.16). ",
            "Gudina’s deep understanding of the Bible is what shaped the principles of his life and is clearly seen in his writings. Gudina as a Chirstian dedicated his entire life to the will of the Lord, everything he wrote about a Christians responsibility he himself practiced. He obeyed the government as an authority placed by God, he never denied the Gospel,  he fought and died to protect the freedom of the Gospel and he remained in prayer to know the will of God at every point in his life. In other words we can say Reverend Gudina Tumsa talked the talk and walked the walk. ",

For example, the time he spent in the United States formed his theology and gave him a new insight on how to build a Church that served the whole man. Two specific things helped form his thoughts on this topic and according to Øyvind M. Eide are, ",
                "“The First that Qes Gudina studied was Reinhold Niebuhr, commonly considered the most powerful theological ethicist of the mid-twentieth century… The second point of importance is the fact that he studied in the USA at the time of the intense debates and struggles of the Civil Rights Movement, led by Martin Luther King.” (Life and Ministry Pg.42). ",
                "These things led Gudina to have a strong will and vision to develop a modern, efficient and Biblical church structure. He did this through thoroughly debating, writing on and presenting solutions on the Church's responsibility to Ecumenical Harmony, Nation Building, Self-reliance and Mission etc... The way that Gudina Tumsa states the church should be structured is clear when he writes about two extremes; over spiritualizing or over secularizing. He presents a solution to this by writing,",
                "“In between these extremes there are those who represent more moderate positions with regard to the understanding of what a responsible church ministry should be in this day and age.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.119). ",
                "Gudina understood a Biblical Church structure as a moderate one, where the Church is not imbalanced in their approach to ministry.",
                "What contributed to Gudina Tumsa’s deep thought on the responsibility of the Church was the radical change that was going on in his country politically, economically and socially. Gudina grew up and began his church service in an imperial society and completed his ministry under a socialists society. This did have a significant impact on Gudina as it did on many others, many of his writings are a response to the specific changes that were going on around him. In his writing it shows how he believed a church was to be built based on its surroundings, ",
                "“A responsible church must always grow out of an “action situation”, or, to go even one step further, true biblical and evangelical Theology must always allow for a contextual interpretation of the Gospel.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.119). ",
                "Another aspect of how Gudina believed in building a responsible Church was to make it a paradigm for society. Gudina strongly believed that the Church should be a leading force in guiding its members through change based on a theological understanding as well as setting the standard for the nation and government in matters of development, economics and even politics.His understanding of this is seen when he writes,",
                "“The ECMY will continue to contribute her share to the economic development of Ethiopia, to improve the living conditions of the people, to the political orientation of the people in being useful to society, in knowing their rights and obligations of citizens.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.67). Gudina Tumsa’s thought on the responsibility of the Church to society can be summed up by saying he pleaded for the Church to have a balanced approach and minister to the spiritual, social, political and economic factors of life. In other words he desired total involvement of the Church. "

Rather it was the first step towards achieving what the Lord desired for His body. Gudina Tumsa believed that the body of Christ was One, not only that but he also had an open mind to discuss and form ecumneical relationships with believers of different denominations as it can be seen in his attempt to form a relationship between the Evangelical Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Gudina Tumsa presented his own theology and plans to form ecumenical harmony that would last and grow into unity; such as “hibret”, the two stages plan, and The Council for Cooperation of Churches in Ethiopia (CCCE). Gudina Tumsa believed in applying the literal definition of the body and the head, as can be seen when he writes, ",
            "Ecumenicity, as demonstrated unity of the household of God, is given in Jesus Christ our high priest.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.165). ",
            "In his conclusion Gudina Tumsa, writes about three schools of thought the first two-spiritualizers and secularizers- are obstacles to ecumenical harmony. On the other hand the third school of thought-the holistic approach- which is what Gudina believed in and applied as can be seen in his writings",
             "“The third school of thought is what I would call the wholistic position. In wholistic theology both the spiritual and physical are taken seriously in an inseparable manner.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.15). ",
            "Through his efforts of creating and maintaining ecumenical relationships Gudina Tumsa along with others was able to establish in 1976 the Council for Cooperation of Churches in Ethiopia which he was elected chairman of. This council incorporated not only Evangelical Churches but also Orthodox and Catholic Churches. Gudina writes this about his attempt at ecumenical harmony",

            "When we look at ecumenical harmony, it is still something that Churches have been unable to achieve today, on the scale Gudina Tumsa writes about. Gudina’s understanding of ecumenical harmony came from his understanding of the gospel and of human nature. He understood that the perfect example of unity was what Chirst prayed for (like husband and wife), but he also understood the shortcomings of people. Thus, his ideas on ecumenical harmony derived from Ephesians 4:2, ",

            "Should this movement be welcomed, be suppressed, or be forced out of the church? From all I understood, it was Gudina Tumsa who was active in trying to move the Mekane Yesus Church into acceptance of the new movement and to prevent the movement in the Mekane Yesus Church from becoming schismatic.”  (Life and Ministry Pg.18)",

              "To understand Gudina’s focus on the topic of unbelief we must go into his childhood and adulthood. As a child Gudina grew up in a family of traditional believers. His family's religious practices showed him the possession, deception and oppression of people through evil spirits. When Gudina accepted the gospel of Jesus Chirst–Which He believed was the liberating power of God– it created a zeal in him that made him want to share that power to unbelievers around him. Gudina was surrounded by unbelief from birth, and once his spiritual eyes were opened, it was a daily battle to ensure darkness “Unbelief” never won over the light “Belief”. His understanding of this battle is seen when he writes, ",
              "In every situation and in every event both divine and demonic elements are at work.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.120).  ",
              "Gudina’s theological understanding and responses were based on the events, context and environment he was in. He wrote on the matter of unbelief in 1976 when the Ethiopian revolution began to take hold of soicalist ideology. Gudina’s primary fear of socialism came from his understanding that it resisted or denied the existence of God. He knew this because he had studied that socialism was influenced by Ludwig Feuerbach’s idea that “God is a creation of man”. Gudina’s understanding of this is found in his writing,  ",
              "“The thought of Feuerbach profoundly influenced the thinking of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Fredrich Engles (1820-1895), the founders of what is called “Scientific Socialism.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.30). ",
              "Gudina’s understanding or some may even say prophetic insights of how socialism threatened the faith led him to writing this article, to push the church to prepare and learn its role in a new society. Gudina saw unless the church equipped itself the upcoming storm would lead many astray.",
              "Gudina Tumsa in this article attempts to identify, define, explain and rebuttal arguments that have been made on unbelief since what he refers to as the early days of life, ",
              "“Unbelief is not something new. It is as old as humankind.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.25). ",
              "Gudina Tumsa goes on to define that unbelief in God is not only denying His existence, but it can also take the form of questioning the truth (God) or the form of covering up one’s misdeeds and denying the responsibility of sin. Some examples of unbelief in his writing are Aristotle’s idea that God is the “Prime Mover”, the deists idea that God is a “Watch maker and the world is a watch”, Ludwig Feuerbach’s idea that “God is a creation of man” and he also brings up different groups of people that fit into the category of unbelief such as “nominalists” and “materialists”. Gudina Tumsa presents on this topic so that the Church would know the challenges it was facing. He understood that the Church would fail as previous churches around the world have, if they did not prepare and just tried to oppress the ideas against the faith. His principle on this can be seen when he writes, ",
              "Our Christian response to expressions of unbeleif and attempts to spread unbelief cannot be one of repression. If we Christians wish that our right to believe and to see belief spread should be respected, we should equally wish that the rights of those who do not or cannot believe should be respected.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.31). ",
              "From what he wrote we can say that Gudina was a believer in fair fights. Gudina’s attempt to prepare the church was also an attempt to encourage the Church as other believers had done in the past. He based his approach on the biblical principle of Hebrews 12:1",
              "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us”. ",
              "Gudina was following the example of believers such as John the Baptist and Paul and through this becoming a part of the cloud of witnesses himself.  Gudina firmly stated in his writing that the Gospel is all powerful, according to him the Gospel is the power that creates a bridge between man and God. ",
              "The gospel is the power of God working in the human heart with a view to transforming man and thereby putting him in the right relationship with God, who is the source and goal of his life, regardless of the stage in the process of historical development at which man finds himself”. (Witness and Discipleship Pg.9). ",
              "Gudina’s belief that the gospel is all powerful led to his belief that the gospel will always be victorious. His belief of a victorious gospel can be seen in his rebuttal statement when he says that no form of unbelief  can disprove the existence of God. Gudina Tumsa’s final and in our opinion most important rebuttal to unbelief is faith, which is seen in his writing. ",
              "“The truly effective testimony against unbelief is a life lived by faith.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.32). ",
              "Faith means believing without seeing and as Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said in John 20:29 “Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.” Both Christ and Gudina present us with a solution and that is faith. Faith is our blessing, our strongest weapon against the pandemic of unbelief. "

            "It was Gudina Tumsa’s vision to develop an African theology that contextualized the gospel for African nations, in political, cultural and economic aspects of life. Gudina writes on multiple occasions about an indeginous understanding of the Gospel, one example of this is, “In our case, theology must grow out of concrete daily experiences, from our dealing with ordinary affairs of life as we experience them in our situation, economic life, in our political experience and in our social practice.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.69). ",

He advocated for a contextual gospel especially in reference to culture, language and the social lives of people, this is  because it creates a sense of meaning and familiarity with the people that it is being preached to. This is seen when he wirtes,",
            "“Contextual theology is making the message of the Gospel of the Risen Lord meaningful and relevant to our life situation, economic life, political life and social life as a whole.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.69). ",
            "An example of Gudina pushing for the contextualization of the Gospel can be seen in his writings about Ethiopia and Africa. Gudina accredits church growth in Ethiopia to the translation of the Bible into indeginous dialects, “It would be unfair not to mention the role the vernacular have played in contributing to church growth in Ethiopia.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.137). ",
            "Gudina understood the main way of contextualization was the language that the Gospel reached the people in. This idea he may have gotten from Martin Luther, who broke the Catholic’s church rule and translated the Bible into the German language. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church applied the same principle as the  Roman Catholic Church; they only ministered in one language and many of the early evangelical churches took the same apporach. All of this led to Gudina fighting for the Gospel to reach people in their own tongue. Gudina understood that language was the first and most important step to contextualizing the Gospel, so that it has a personal value to the reader.  ",
            "Another part of Gudina’s African theological understanding came for his understanding of the division between Western and African values of life. In multiple of his writings Gudina can be seen discussing how Western ideas cannot and will not apply in Africa. As the political, economic and social structures of life are far too different from one another, When addressing the Lutheran World Federation Gudina said, “We would like to call attention to the traditional African concept of life and the Western concept, which has created a credibility gap between the recipient churches in Africa and the supporting and donor agencies in the West.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.123). ",
            "Gudina Tumsa’s various writings on the division between Western and African life shows two things. Firstly, the Gospel is not a generalization rather a specialization and that Gudina Tumsa himself was a Pan-Africanist who was living through colonialism and the post colonialism era, which created that starting block for his idea to develop an indgenious or home grown theology.",
            "Gudina’s reasoning for promoting an African theology was to influence the newly established African Churches to develop individual and distinct features in order to follow the calling of God.This is seen when he writes, “National character, identity and integrity are a must for a church in a given society if she is to fulfill the commission of her Lord.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.102). ",
            "His attempt at constructing an African theology, was not only to relate the Gospel to the people of Africa, but also to help African churches become self reliant, become partners– not dependents– with foreign missions, and lastly to make the Church a model for the recuperation that Africa needed after the devastating colonial period. Gudina Tumsa was murdered and was never able to develop his idea of an African theology, which would have been able to minister to the life situation of Africans. Today the Church in Africa needs to restructure and form its own theology that can minister to the life of Africa's struggling people. This can be done from using the foundation that Gudina Tumsa laid for us. As Øyvind M. Edie writes,  “Qes Gudina was not given the opportuntiy to develop a “Confessio Africana”, but his integrated approach to human developments and his theology of “love and justice” may serve as a guideline for further reflection on the task of the church in a continent ravaged by conflict and deep human suffering.” (Life and Ministry Pg.73) "

            "Gudina Tumsa had a unique view on youth for the time period he lived in, even in the present day a widespread culture is that the youth are viewed as unknowledgeable and thus are discouraged from being involved or even heard on matters “adults”, deem above them.  As Rev.Megersa Guta writes it was uncommon in his time, “There is a widespread culture that discourages the young from expressing themselves.” (Life and Ministry Pg.145).  But Gudina Tumsa was not of that sort. What may have influenced Gudina is that as a young boy he left his home, went out on his own and faced the extreme challenges of life such as poverty, hunger and loneliness. As if that were not enough he took on additional burden when he began to raise his orphaned siblings. Here again Gudina’s life follows a Biblical principle found in Lamentations 3:27,  “It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.” (KJV). ",
            "Gudina from his own life understood the potential and capability in the youth and so it was common to find Gudina Tumsa in discussions about deep topics with young people. Rev Dr. Yonas Deressa describes Gudina’s view on the youth in this way,  “I also had the privilege of listening to his advice to secondary school and University students. He used to urge Christian students to work hard and assume their position among Ethiopian intellectuals. It was also his advice that these students take faith in Christ seriously and explain it to the educated in a way that they can comprehend it intellectually.” (Life and MInistry Pg.12).  ",
            "Gudina Tumsa did not only believe that the youth should be valued and discussed, but he understood a secret that many still today fail to understand, and that is that, “The Youth are the Foundation for Tomorrow”. This can be seen when Rev Dr. Yonas Deressa quoted Gudina Tumsa saying,  “The generation that would build upon the foundation should participate in the evangelistic work and church leadership.” (Life and MInistry Pg.9). ",

            "His care for the youth did not only come from his concern for the future. But it also arose from the events unfolding before him. In Ethiopia during the early 1970’s a revolution was occurring, the vanguard of that revolution was University students. This revolution being led by students was deeply personal to Gudina as his own brother Baro Tumsa was one of the students leading the revolution. The activity occurring in and through the youth during that time period, including, his own brother, also may have been a decisive factor that instituted in Gudina the importance of shaping young people."

            "“The healing of the Brokenness in human life can therefore never be accomplished without the gospel message of forgiveness which has in itself the power to liberate man from the most dehumanizing power in his own life and his relationships with other men and God.” ",

            "Gudina Tumsa wrote extensively on holistic theology, according to him holistic theology can be defined as,  “An effort in rediscovering total human life.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.70).  Where did Gudina Tumsa’s understanding of  holistic ministry come from? One specific thing can not be pinpointed to answer this question, rather we have to look at his life as a whole. At first Gudina Tumsa understood the Bible according to (Matthew 5,11 ) these scriptures gave him the inclination to believe that the gospel should and could reach all parts of people’s lives. Gudina’s claim that a holistic ministry is necessary, comes from him experiencing and seeing the lack that the people he ministered to lived in. His belief that the Gospel was the most powerful force, influenced his view on the living situation of his people. The only way he saw out of the desperation, was a holistic ministry: a ministry to the body, soul and development of man. ",
            "In his later life, Gudina began to understand that the Gospel transcended everything, along with his understanding of the Gospel he also began to understand the systems developed by mankind such as politics, economics etc… His holistic view allowed him to acknowledge that the systems impacted the individuals that lived within them. Gudina’s perspective of viewing everything through the Gospel then expanded to include the economy, politics, and social issues. It clicked in Gudina’s mind that the Gospel was independent and superior to these things and since the Gospel was in itself Jesus Christ, it had dominion of the earthly concepts developed by mankind. Gudina wirtes on this in his last will and testament “The Role of a Christian in a Given Society”,  “The Chrisitan Gospel refuses to be identified or to be considered as part of Feudalism or Capitalism, and as such it cannot fade away with these systems, since by its nature the Gospel of Christ is totally different from them. Christ himself is the Gospel. There is no Gospel apart from his presence with us in our daily labor.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.9)",
            "From his writings it is clear that the holistic approach is how Gudina chose to understand, explain and apply the Gospel in all contexts. Gudina’s zeal for Christ cannot be separated from his holistic understanding of the Chrsitan’s commission from the Lord. We cannot discuss his ideas on politics, youth, Western and African theology, Ethiopian church growth and ethnicity etc… without understanding the high regard he viewed the holistic gospel in. Gudina shows the value he has placed on holistic theology when he writes this,  “In wholistic theology both the spiritual and physical are taken seriously in an inseparable manner.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.15). ",
            "Holistic theology explains why Gudina Tumsa had such strong positions on inclusivity, spritualization and secularizations, missionary aid in the Church and serving the “whole man”. His holistic understanding made it evident to him that the Gospel was not there just to save the spirit but also serve the physical,  “There is no distinction between curing from malaria, pneumonia, or saving from sin. “Jesus Christ saves''means that he literally cures from physical diseases, as well as from the burden of sin.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.136). ",
            "The holistic Gospel or theology is the only accurate approach that Gudina Tumsa believed could save the world. And today we agree that there can be no other way to approach our call to Christ. We must minister with a holistic approach as our Lord Jesus Christ did. To conclude we leave you with Gudina’s ultimate reasoning to pursue a holistic ministry,  “The ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ can be summarized under three aspects which together fulfilled one purpose, namely, to restore man to what he should be according to God's plan in creation… He (Jesus Christ) was seeking those who were lost to bring them back to fellowship with God… He involved himself  in all genuine human suffering to heal and make people whole… He gave His life to redeem sinner and offer forgiveness on the basis of his redemptive death…” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.122)"

                "Gudina Tumsa to most people is known as a theologian, and while that was his main purpose and passion, due to his holistic view on life he believed that the gospel is directly tied to/ influences daily life and human structures. As is seen when he writes, “The Gospel of Jesus Christ is God's power to save everyone who believes it. It is the power that saves from eternal damnation, from economic exploitation, from political oppression, etc. Because of its eternal dimension the gospel could never be replaced by any of the ideologies invented by men throughout the centuries.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.76). What leads many to today to limit or catagorize Gudina into one section of life is the misunderstanding that a person can’t be more than one thing. Gudina was not a one trick pony, but rather a multifaceted instrument of God, and because God engulfs all aspects of life, His instruments that are made in his likeness have the same capability within them. ",
                "What led Gudina Tumsa to be so involved in politics from a theological perspective was the interaction he chose to have with society. As Rev. Yonas Deresa writes, “He preached or prayed for in plain language. But he also included other concerns that beset the society in which he lived. These included social, political, economical and other factors.” (Life and Ministry Pg.12).This quote shows why Gudina believed the Church and a Christian must be involved in the society. Many Chrsitans may disagree with Gudina Tumsa’s beleif that theology is involved with politics, but a possible response to this disagreement by Gudina Tumsa has the capablitly to change the way the church and christans apporach politcs in the present and the future is, “The history of the people of God in the Old Testament starts with the liberation of a group of slaves from oppression. Nothing is more political than this biblical narrative.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.70). In conclusion, to understand Gudina’s political involvement we must return our attention to his holistic theology. Gudina understood politics played a role in religion and that an individual of faith could not completely tear themselves away from society, he shows this when he writes,“A political life is not worthy of existence, uninvolvement is a denial of the goodness of creation and of the reality of incarnation.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.70).",
                "While many Christians think that economics is outside of the jurisdiction of God, once again Gudina Tumsa’s holistic view differs from that of the masses. He claims that the Church and Christians should have their own economy. “We believe that the economy of the Christian community should be seen in a global perspective and the aim should be to arrange for a more fair distribution of resources. Here the Church should even lead the way towards this goal.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.126). Gudina was not a man of theory who just spoke about the Church's economic growth but he put it into action as he planned for the Church to become self-reliant in its ministry. ",
                "Gudina was a man who saw Christ as the Alpha and the Omega, not only in the spiritual sense but also on Earth. Gudina understood that the Earth was Christ's dominion meaning God’s Kingdom led and still leads earthly kingdoms. This is seen when Gudina applies his holistic approach and called on Churches and Christian’s to build and develop the economy of their country as the Churches (God’s Kingdom) and countries (Earth’s Kingdom) economies are intertwined, “It is a well-known fact that the economic life of any church is tied up with the economic life of the country where the church is placed.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.139). Gudina was raised by poor farmers in an imperial system. An oppressive system that preyed on the so called “peasants”. His stance on landrefrom and the letter he along with ECMY members wrote to the Ethiopian parliament in 1973 was a plea to better the economic lives of the Ethiopian people. To conclude, Gudina knew that a prosperous economy could only be developed if it was developed in a model that mirrored a Christian or Church economy, and the Christian economy is based on God’s will for the people within it; that will is  justice and equality. Thus, he made it his mission and the Churches to begin involving themselves in economic development and become the necessary paradigm for society so that there can be balanced economic growth. "

        paragraph: [
        "The “cost of discipleship”, is a well known book written by Dietrich Bonhoffer. Ditrech Bonhoffer was a Lutheran German Pastor, theologian and anti-Nazi dissiedent who was hung in 1945 by the Nazi government. Gudina Tumsa’s understanding of the cost of discipleship came from what Paul E. Hoffmann describes as Gudina’s following of Dietrich Bonhoffer, “Using the striking phrase in English drawn for Dietrich Bonhoffer, Gudina Tumsa called for “costly discipleship.” (Life and Ministry Pg.27). ",   
            "“To Believe in Christ is to take the form of a servant, to be a servant for others.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.71). Gudina Tumsa himself paid the ultimate price of discipleship according to Jesus Christ in (John 15:13). Gudina Tumsa was a martyr for the sake of the Gospel. His stance for the Gospel can be seen in a letter he wrote to an unidentified individual,  “We as Christians cannot simply tolerate a bad situation and keep quiet. It is our duty to act, to speak, and even to risk our life. The power of resurrection is experienced only through death.”  He wrote this during the Red Terror which was a time for great scrutiny for the Churches in Ethiopia. Soon after he refused to join the Derg government on a goodwill tour to Europe and was then abducted and killed. All of this shows that Gudina Tumsa is someone worthy to write on the Cost of Discipleship as he had to pay a price for his.  The cost of discipleship to many of us is a foreign concept, and even if we do understand the concept we are not ready to make the necessary sacrifice for our discipleship. Although Gudina Tumsa paid the ultimate price for his discipleship, he makes it clear that each one of us has a different way of sacrificing for our discipleship,  “The demands for the cost of discipleship will be met by various responses from each one of us.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.74). ",
            "Gudina understood the body of Christ and how each part has a different function, but all the parts have one thing in common: they all serve the same body. Gudina defines the bases of discipleship as servanthood to the body of Christ (Matthew 23:11). To become a disciple is to serve one’s Lord and country, give up luxury and personal interests for the purpose of the Gospel. Gudina’s writings on the cost of discipleship should influence believers today to make a decision to completely follow the call of their Lord Jesus Christ, and make the necessary sacrifices to become His disciples. We conclude in giving an example of what truly following Christ looks like according to Gudina Tumsa,  “In this matter, which is so personal to every one of us, we have to make decisions affecting our personal interest, our living standard, the luxury that we enjoy, thereby setting an example for the government as for others concerned, not by words but by actions of sacrificial nature. This is what it means to be the church for others. Jesus Christ lived and sacrificed himself for us.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.73)"

              "In our view a one-sided material development is not only self-deceiving, in the sense that man needs more than that, but it is also a threat to the very values which make life meaningful, if carried without due attention to a simultaneous provision to meet spiritual needs.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.88)",
            "Unless our people are helped to the spiritual freedom and maturity which enables them responsibly to handle material development, we are afraid that what was intended to be a means of enhancing the well being of man can have the opposite effect and create new forms of evil to destroy him.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.89)"

          paragraph: [
              " The world’s definition of development is along the lines of technological advancement and economic growth and the building of infrastructure. Gudina saw human development very differently from what many people call “development”, this can be accredited to his deep love for the Gospel. As defined by him, human development is, “In our opinion, an integral human development, where spiritual and material needs are seen together, is the only right approach to the development question in our society.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.123). Gudina Tumsa knew and understood that there was more to development than technology. He understood that human development was not one dimensional, rather many dimensions are needed to develop a positive society such as: the spiritual, economic, technological aspects. He believed unless individuals were developed in an integral manner, society as a whole would have to face the consequences of imbalance growth. Gudina perfectly wrote that there is more to technological advancement when he states “That they are values in life beyond those of modern technology in economic betterment, without which commands development will never be meaningful and lasting.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.88) ",
              "In order to understand why Gudina believed there was more to human development we must understand who he was. Gudina Tumsa was a man who chose to become a minister to the Lord over receiving an education in the medical field. Gudina was a man who believed that God’s calling was of utmost importance and the pure Gospel of Jesus Christ trumped everything else as is evident when Paul E. Hoffmann describes him saying “Preaching the Good News that Jesus Christ is Lord always had for Gudina, as I came to know him, the highest priority.” (Life and Ministry Pg.15). This being said, we also must understand that Gudina Tumsa was not a fanatic who spiritualized everything, he was not against technological and economic advancement as can be seen in his writing, “We know that we need more of modern technology. We need more equipment and know-how to use it.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.88). In order to understand this we must refocus on the source of Gudina’s theology, which is holistic. His holistic view created a balance in him that he wanted to see in all humans. Gudina believed and wrote that overall integral human development was not only beneficial to humans but to all the creatures of the earth. “That man is not only the suffering creature who needs help, but that he is the most important development agent”, (Witness and Discipleship Pg.88). Which not only mirrors but is derived from Romans 8:19 “For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed”. From his writings it is obvious that Gudina was a supporter and advocate for human development, but not in a traditional way. In a unique way, which he writes about, “We therefore see the development of the inner man as a pre-requisite for a healthy and lasting development of our society.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.89)",
              "The development occurring in the present day is extremely fascinating, as new developments such as artificial intelligence, the internet, mobile phones, self-driving cars, etc… are becoming integral parts to daily life. This has led people to call the present age the information age, an era of extreme advancement. This advancement is leading many to claim that society is as developed as it has ever been, but Gudina Tumsa would differ in his opinion this is seen when he writes, “Looking at the so-called developed societies we realize that in the midst of their affluence man is still suffering from all kinds of evil.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.89). Although society is developing at an unprecedented pace, many people are beginning to fear what the power of development is doing to society, as global phenomena such as climate change, pandemics, economic crises and moral perversions are becoming recurrent. Gudina Tumsa can be seen predicting this when he writes, “True, man can organize the world apart from God, but without God we can organize it, in the end, only against man.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.89. It is not an exaggeration to say that these words from Gudina are a prophetic utterance, an example of this is the fear many people have of robots replacing them in their jobs, risks of nuclear and biological warfare and extreme natural disasters. Society has developed itself without God and now it is facing the consequences for its imbalance growth. Gudina found himself with one conclusion to fix this problem and that is to turn to the creator of the creation we are abusing."

                "Division of resources may be a foregin concept to many people today, as sharing is not an important part of society in the present day. But during Gudina’s time as the General Secretary of the ECMY, division of resources fairly between churches was of importance as many of the churches in Africa needed support to carry out missions. Because of this Gudina wrote extensively on how resources should be divided, why resources are shared, the fact that resources are from God and how resources should not shape the relationship between churches. Gudina’s idea that the Churches are obligated to share came from his belief in the Lord’s prayer in John 17:21 for the Church did not only mean oneness in spirit, confession and faith but in every way, as a man is one with his wife. Gudina’s overarching idea on the Church of Christ and the division of resources amongst her can be seen in this quote, “Our Lord is the Head of the church; all who believe are members of the body. The resources available to any particular church are to be used by all other churches wherever there is a need.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.63).",
                "To get a glimpse of how Gudina Tumsa understood sharing resources we can turn to Paul E.  Hoffmann’s description of him, “He pressed for acceptance of the idea of “interdependence in the Body of Christ'', no church being autonomous, “independent” of the gifts and weakness of other in the international fellowship of the churches of Christ, all being willing, on principle, to share spiritual and also financial resources with one another.” (Life and Ministry Pg.26). Many factors in Gudina Tumsa’s life contributed to him having a strong opinion on sharing. Gudina Tumsa’s first idea of sharing most likely came from his strong desire to share the gospel with his fellow people after he had discovered it to be the truth. As Yonas Deresa writes about Gudina’s first experiences as a Chirstian, “He boldly faced the criticism of the people and urged them to believe in Christ the source of all blessings and the savior of the world.” (Life and Ministry Pg.5). His deep desire to share could have also come from the life of poverty he lived. Stories have been told about how Guinda suffered from hunger as a young man. Stories such as this one: when Gudina was hungry he used to lick salt to make himself thirsty and then would go to the river and drink water to make himself feel full. Although Gudina was poor the principle of sharing was instilled in him as he took in his orphaned siblings and as many claim he had a deep heart for the poor. Stories about his heart for the poor are deeply moving. People say he would do things for the poor such as, dividing his salary amongst them, and whenever Gudina would see poor people he would get emotional. His heart for the poor forced him to share, because he understood their pain and knew that help was needed to get out. To conclude Gudina’s sharing principle was instilled in him by the Biblical principle in 2 Corinthians 1:4 where it says, “Who Comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.” Gudina practiced this scripture throughout his life, but it was most evident when he stood in front of the Norwegian Missionary Society and said, “Here I am standing as your poor brother, begging you to come out and help us in our evangelsitic outreach. You know that no one prides himself in begging; however, I am not ashamed of it, because I know that I am appealing to my brothers.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.141)",
                "Churches and people may wonder why a fair division of resources in the Church is necessary, because human thinking tends to apply this logic: why should A be responsible for B. Gudina Tumsa gives a biblical and great response to this, that should shape current day Church relations, “The various parts of the universal Church are and should be interdependent.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.49). The Church of Christ must be fair in the way they divide resources because they must grow together as they are a part of one body and one system, the Church just like human development must grow in a balanced way. Gudina explains in an exemplary way when he writes, “As members of the body, we work for the same cause, striving to reach the same goal to make our Lord Jesus Chirst known to the world.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.141). Gudina Tumsa was comparing the Church sharing resources to the way the human body shares oxygen, nutrients, white blood cells etc... To conclude Gudina Tumsa makes it clear through his opinions on moratorium that the Church is interdependent, not only for financial resources but spiritual resources. He directly addresses the topic that has confused so many and that is the separation of the economic and the spiritual which according to Gudina’s holistic view is completely wrong. He showed his holistic understanding of the universal Church when he wrote this, “The various parts of the universal Church are and should be interdependent. Independence is a legitimate national political aim; it can never be an acceptable theological aim for a church.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.49)"

Christians are commanded to be a good steward with what God has given to them as can be seen in (1 Cor 4:1-2 and Mattew 25:14-30). As a man of prayer Gudina understood that stewardship was something required of both the Church and Chirsitans. Stewardship in essence is responsibility. The Church and Christians have many responsibilities to God and to believers. But a common mistake that is made today is that the Church along with Christians limit stewardship to a single responsibility usually along the lines of finance… But Gudina Tumsa understood it in a different way, a holistic way, which shows continuity in his thought process. Gudina wrote how stewardship should be practiced, “ The description of Stewardship, therefore , should not be confined to a narrow area of life, describing only the relationship to property, which is a summon notion. Stewardship must be understood in its broader sense, as the New Testament presents it, including all areas of Chrstian responsibility and the whole response of love.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.151)",
                  "Gudina wrote on Chrsitian stewardship because he believed in a Chrsitian being faithful to the ministry God has entrusted to them. Gudina is a qualified individual to comment on the topic of stewardship as he did what was required of him by the Lord making himself an example of stewardship. Bishop Chiristian Krause recounts Gudina’s example of stewardship in this way, “He said to me: “How can I leave the country, my church, being a leader of this flock? I have to stay.”(Church and Society Pg.113). Gudina was presented with an option to leave his country, escape torture, death and the sepreation of his family, yet he chose to stay claiming that it was God’s calling for him to stay with his church and country, just as Chris stayed with this world until then end. Once we are able to comprehend Gudina Tumsa’s understanding of stewardship was much deeper than what we define as stewardship today. His definition of stewardship was holistic–exactly like the rest of his understanding of life–  We believe that applying Gudina Tumsa’s definition of stewardship can influence Chirstians and Churches all around the world to follow Christ-like stewardship. Gudina begins defining Christ like stewardship by identifying the source, he writes, “Stewardship obtains its highest meaning and strongest theological foundation when the Apostle relates it to God's purpose which he set forth in Christ.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.153). The second key to understanding  Gudina’s opinions on stewardship is acknowledging the holistic gospel. Gudina believed that stewardship was service to Christ and to people, stewardship that served the spirit and the physical and the theme of stewardship according to Gudina is obedience. By practicing holistic stewardship that related to God’s purpose Gudina Tumsa was able to be a faithful steward even in the face of death. ",
                  "Today, how can we practice such stewardship? Firstly, according to Gudina we must remove the idea that stewardship refers only to the resources that God has given us; in order to do this we must take the holistic approach. Gudina in his writings tells us how our holistic stewardship should come out of the Gospel as it is our foundation of faith , “Since the Gospel is “the power of God”, we are possessed by it and placed in a world where the new law of love regulates our life, directing our mind, thoughts and emotions to the service of the Gospel of the living Jesus Chirst”. (Witness and Discipleship Pg.151). To conclude Gudina’s view on stewardship; we can refer to his writing of what true stewardship is: “As Stewards our responsibility is to transmit that which was delivered to us.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.154). This quote from Gudina’s writings, tell us one clear thing whe should not over complicate stewardship. Gudina took the simplistic approach by following the written scriptures about the perfect steward, our High Priest Jesus Christ. "

              paragraph: [
                  "Gudina Tumsa was surrounded by missionaries throughout his life. From his childhood hearing, the gospel preached to him for the first time, to being educated in the Swedish Mission, translating for missionary doctors at the Teferi Mekonen hospital and later becoming a missionary himself in Kambata and Hadiya. If it weren’t for these missions in Ethiopia, today we would not be talking about Gudina Tumsa as a theologian. Thus, we must understand that Gudina Tumsa had respect and love for missions and missionaries as he had seen them save many and was saved by them himself. None of Gudina’s writings or opinions on missions came from dislike, but from an understanding that missions had to grow into indgenious churches and that although missions were from developed countries, the human standards did not apply in the Church of Christ. As the Churches of Christ were equal before the Lord. Gudina valued mission and believed that the first responsibility of all Chiritians and Churches were called to evangelize by Christ. “The Church is first of all commissioned to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to All Nations.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.121)",
                  "Gudina Tumsa understood that missions played a crucial role in spreading the Gospel of Jesus Chirst and he gives them credit for this in his writings. His value for the missions comes from his understanding that the missions and donors have had significant impact on the development and evangelstic work that is necessary for a holistic approach in Churches who did not have the capability to do it themselves: This is seen when he presents reasoning his reasoning to reject moratorium, “The most convincing argument, however, is that the ECMY needs the continuing assistance of sister churches around the world, both in funds and personnel, because of the development and evangelsitic tasks which the church must continue.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.49).  According to Oyvind M. Eide writes that Gudina acknowledged that the Churches in the third world are dependent on missions to complete the responsibility that God has given to the Church, “Qes Gudina acknowledged the dependence and need for the EECMY to keep in contact with the missions in order to share resources.” (Life and Ministry Pg.58). Gudina himself acknowledged that a lot of the Church work in Ethiopia and even the EECMY’s work had been done through the aid of missions.  ",
                  "Although Gudina did value and believe in missions. He believed that missions had to evolve and become or integrate into an indgenious church. He believed this was necessary because he felt that the locals had to feel in touch with the worship of the Lord, he wanted the local people to have a sense of ownership over how they worshiped. Gudina came to this conclusion by  studying and understanding that missions played a vital role in bringing the gospel into Ethiopia. But in his research he also found that the most rapid and reliable Church growth or revival in Ethiopia occured when the missions had to leave due to Italian occupation in WWII. His research is seen in this quote, “The departure of foreign missions due to World War II may be considered one of the contributing factors to the spread of the gospel in the country.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.132). This is when Gudina’s understanding of the importance of a contextualized gospel kicked in. He came to the conclusion that the departure of the missions left the indgeinous believers without their “support system”. So the believers had to come up with their own understanding of the faith–They no longer had a teacher to instruct them– So the believers had to turn to the Bible which on the topic of contextualization says in Revelation 7:9, “After this I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation,tribe,people and language, standing before the Lamb…”. As the believers turned to the Bible this led to major growth of the faith. According to Gudina, based on the highest authority (The Word of God) the believers were able to contextualize the Gospel and form a sense of ownership, “The missionaries, to whom they used to look to draw advice, counseling and assistance, were, so to speak, replaced by the Bible. The only authority to appeal to on ethical questions in the absence of missionaries was the Bible.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.132).  Gudina writes on how the believers contextualized the Gospel in this quote, “It is significant to note that the revival movements developed some type of indgenous pattern. The missions used to teach Western melodies. Now that was seen as a matter of the past, and the revival movements started making use of primitive indigenous melodies, whereby the believers were helped to feel at home with the message proclaimed to them.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.133).  We see that Gudina’s research came to the conclusion that the leaving of the missions, the adoption of the Bible as a leading force, led the believers in Italian occupied Ethiopia to find a supplement of growth in their own understanding of the gospel.``It is significant to note that the revival movements developed some type of indgenous pattern. The missions used to teach Western melodies. Now that was seen as a matter of the past, and the revival movements started making use of primitive indigenous melodies, whereby the believers were helped to feel at home with the message proclaimed to them.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.133) ",
                  "To understand Gudina’s writings on missions we must know the context of the time the missions were working in Africa. This was during the colonial and post colonial era and many of the missions took on a similar attitude to their home countries, and that was an attitude of “paternalism” or “colonialism.” Gudina was influenced by the heavy pan-African movement at that time, as can be seen in his desire to develop an African theology, and that theology was affected by the experiences that all Afircan’s were experiencing through colonialism and underdevelopment. Gudina saw this in the Church based on his belief that the Church cannot be separated from its surroundings. “This kind of paternalistic, colonial attitude can never be tolerated, can never be accepted.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.109). This quote shows how Gudina related the events going on between Western Countries and Africa to relationships of the Western Churches and African Churches. Gudina specifically wrote this when he was referring to how MAH, a German mission, was trying to tell the ECMY how to interpret their own constitution on an issue related to a synod of the ECMY. Gudina strongly disagreed with this and addressed the Western missions in the way they thought of the third world Churches as immature. Because of this, Gudina rebuked the MAH saying, “The MAH did not act only against the law of the Country, the MAH acted contrary to the letter and the spirit of the Constitution of The ECMY.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.104). As for the third world countries Gudina gave them this message, “As I have stated already, we would not like to be, we can never be, an agent for rich missions organizations, donor agencies and churches. Let it be clear to all that the ECMY is not an agent to carry out policies and decisions taken in Europe or America, nor is the ECMY willing to fulfill the purpose of international organizations, which appears to be contrary to what she holds to be right. We want to be ourselves.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.109). Addressing that the Churches should be a paradigm, and set an example for how African governments should respond to Western pressure.",
                  " In conclusion, Gudina did not only identify the problems that the Church was facing in relation to missions and donors, but he also presented solutions, for both the Church and the nation. And for both the solution was “self-reliance”. In the case of the Church Gudina advocated for self-reliance but interdependence with the universal Church. Gudina writes about how self-reliance should be approached, while maintaining the biblical understanding of the body of Christ. “Chirstian responsibility demands that we should march towards self-reliance in a planned manner, while at the same time maintaining Chirstian integrity.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.64). For the nation Gudina understood that nationalism and sovereignty were of utmost importance. Gudina understood that a nation's independence was necessary for that nation to be seen as equal to other nations. His opinion on the self-reliance in a nation is made clear when he wrote, “Independence is a legitimate national political aim.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.49). Gudina was able to apply his theological understanding of a situation at a Church and National level. Showing his ability for deep thought and showing that the Church is directly affected by its surroundings. And that society can be modeled after the Church, if the Church does minister in a Biblical and holistic approach."

                  "Many people have paid their taxes throughout history with a promise from the state that the tax revenue would be used to better the standard of living. As many of us know today, our taxes are used to build infrastructure, provide health care, security etc… It may be puzzling some what the legacy of Gudina Tumsa has to do with paying taxes, and in order to understand this we must refer to Gudina’s last will and testament “The Responsibility of a Chiristian in a Given Society.” In that document Gudina writes that Christians and Churches had a greater responsibility to a nation than just paying their taxes, “A Christian does not stop with paying what is due to the State, such as various; he does more than that by being honest and by fulfilling the demands of the State for the sake of conscience.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.7). Throughout his writings, his holistic understanding influenced him to push the Church and Christians to get involved in development work, collaborating with the government, and to build a better society morally, physically and spiritually.",
                  "Gudina Tumsa understood that the Church and a Chiristian had a responsibility to the nation that God placed it in. As can be seen in this quote, “We have not been given a choice as to where we should be born; we believe that God has placed us where we are to do His will” (Pg.2 Witness and Discipleship). Gudina applied his belief of a Chrsitans responsibility in his private life and Church ministry. As leader of the EECMY Gudina during his time there led the Church to work tirelessly to improve the livelihood of the people in Ethiopia. Gudina writes about the efforts of The EECMY in this way, “Through its health, educational and other services, the ECMY has contributed meaningfully to the development of Ethiopia.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.82). Gudina recognized that along with the Churches prime responsibility of spreading the gospel, she also had equal responsibility to better the lives of the people she ministered to, showing his holistic understanding and how it applied in the sense of complete Church ministry. During the Imperial government the EECMY ministered to the needs of people through running institutions. But Gudina in response to the radical change that occurred with the establishment of the socialist government saw the institutional approach of the Church running such facilities as a hindrance, because the public misunderstood it as the Church running a business, and the new socialsit government could have interpreted this as the Church competing with it. This misinterpretation led Gudina To present a new and better way for the Church to work in nation building.",
                  "Gudina’s new approach can be found in the Memorandum he wrote to EECMY President Emmanuel Abraham, and it is called the functional approach. According to Gudina, the functional approach meant the church would work with the government by handing over the institutions established by the EECMY. “The government has indicated its intention to take care of all the educational, medical and development needs of the people. THe Church welcomes this move of the Government and plans to hand over these institutions.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.82). Gudina understood that the Church was not like other institutions, in regards to its main purpose was not profit. Thus he deemed the functional approach to be the best way for the Church to work with a willing government to improve people’s lives. But to him the functional approach also menat helping the people help themselves. This is seen when he writes in the Memorandum, “At present the Ethiopian people are in active process of being organized, taking their destiny into their own hands. Marching forward towards handling their own affairs and deciding for themselves.” (Witness and Discipleship Pg.60). The short story of feeding a Man a fish best describes Gudina’s approach to nation building. He did not agree with giving them a fish and feeding them for a day, nor did Gudina agree with teaching them how to fish and feed them for a lifetime. Gudina concluded that the best way for the Church to build a nation was to teach the people how to own the lake and feed themselves for generations"
